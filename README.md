# Face_Mask_Detection_Using_CNN
The Face Mask Detection project is a deep learning–based system designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV to classify faces into two categories — "Mask" and "No Mask" — using images or live webcam feeds.
